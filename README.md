**The Agent-Native File System.**

puppyone is an open-source context infrastructure that gives AI agents an agent native file system.

- **Connected** — Pull context from SaaS tools (Notion, GitHub, Gmail, Google Drive, Airtable…), databases, and the web into agent-friendly, accessible files.
- **Collaborative** — A file system rebuilt for agents: agent-level auth, versioning & rollback, conflict resolution, backup, audit logs, and traceability. Traditional file systems never had any of this.
- **Accessible** — Your agents can access the file system via SSH, Bash, MCP, REST API, or sandboxed containers.

## Why puppyone?

Today's context infrastructure was built for humans. Agents need something different:

- **SaaS silos** — Deep context is locked inside Notion, GitHub, Google Drive, Airtable, Gmail, and dozens of other tools. Agents can't reach it without custom integrations for each one.
- **No collaboration layer** — Traditional file systems have no concept of agent-level permissions, version history, or audit trails. Multi-agent teamwork is impossible without them.
- **No distribution** — Getting context *into* an agent's environment (Cursor, Claude Desktop, a sandbox, your own scripts) requires glue code every time.

puppyone solves all three.

## Connected

Connect context from SaaS tools, databases, and the web into agent-friendly files.

puppyone provides OAuth connectors for **15+ platforms** — including Notion, GitHub, Gmail, Google Drive, Linear, Airtable, Google Sheets, Google Calendar, and more. It also supports URL scraping, database connections, local folder sync, and custom scripts.

All data is transformed into agent-friendly formats (Markdown, JSON, raw files) and stored in your **Context Space** — a cloud file system that any agent can browse like a local directory.

## Collaborative

Agent-level auth, versioning, audit, and collaboration — built for agents, not humans.

- **File Level Security (FLS)** — Per-agent file permissions enforced at the filesystem layer. If an agent doesn't have access, the file physically doesn't exist in its environment. Think Row Level Security (RLS), but for files.
- **Version history & rollback** — File-level versioning with diff comparison and one-click rollback. Folder-level snapshots for bulk recovery.
- **Audit logs** — Every read and write operation is recorded: who did what, to which file, and when.
- **Checkout / commit workflow** — Locking, conflict detection, and resolution for concurrent agent edits.

## Accessible

One Context Space, many ways in. Your agents access it however they work best:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — Auto-generated MCP endpoints for each agent. Connect Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cline, or any MCP-compatible client in seconds.
- **Sandbox** — Isolated Docker/E2B containers with only the authorized files mounted. Agents execute code securely without seeing anything they shouldn't.
- **REST API** — Full programmatic access. Read, write, query, and manage everything.
- **CLI** — Every operation available via `puppyone` command line, so AI coding tools like Claude Code can drive the platform directly.
- **Local folder sync** — Real-time bidirectional sync between local directories and the cloud Context Space via the OpenClaw protocol.
