# Agent Access & Tools 🚀

Turn your context into **Active Tools**.

## How it works

Instead of dumping all text into the chat, you create a **Tool**.

## Example

Check the `Tool_Configs` folder below.
We created a **"Report Generator"** tool that:

1. Reads the `[Gmail]` thread (once connected).
2. Reads the `[Google Sheets]` data (once connected).
3. Generates a weekly summary automatically.

👉 **Your agents can call this tool directly via MCP!**
