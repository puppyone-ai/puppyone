# Multi-Agent Collaboration 🤝

Not all agents are equal. You need **Granular Access Control**.

## The Scenario

- **Root Agent** (You): Sees everything.
- **Claude Bot** (Guest): Should NOT see sensitive data.

## Try this

1. Select **Claude Bot** in the right panel.
2. Notice how `Q1_Budget_Data.json` becomes **Invisible** or **Read-Only** (depending on your setting).
3. You control exactly what context each agent "consumes".
