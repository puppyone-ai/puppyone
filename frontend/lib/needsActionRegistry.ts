/**
 * Needs Action — kind registry.
 *
 * Per PUP-5 §6 D5: a single registry exports kind definitions; the
 * Section + Group components iterate it. New plugin kinds add an entry
 * here (or in a sibling module) — they don't have to touch the section
 * UI. The contract is intentionally tiny so plugin authors can ship a
 * kind without learning the rest of the page.
 *
 * Type-level safety: ``NeedsActionItem`` is a discriminated union
 * keyed by ``kind`` so consumers (renderRow / renderDetail) only see
 * the fields applicable to the kind they registered for. The registry
 * itself is loosely typed because each entry types its own row type
 * separately — we don't want to push the union back through every
 * call site.
 *
 * v1 registers exactly two kinds:
 *   - ``pending-review`` — agent-claimed conflict awaiting human OK
 *   - ``conflict``       — manual three-way conflict awaiting human resolve
 *
 * Both pull from the same ``mut_conflicts`` backend table, split by
 * ``resolver_kind`` + ``policy``. See ``items/pendingReviewKind.ts``
 * and ``items/conflictKind.ts`` for the concrete entries.
