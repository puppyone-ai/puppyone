# Tools & Permissions

Control what your AI agents can do with your data.

## Tool Types

PuppyOne provides fine-grained control over agent capabilities:

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `query_data` | Read | Query data with JSON path filters |
| `get_all_data` | Read | Fetch entire table contents |
| `create` | Write | Add new entries to the table |
| `update` | Write | Modify existing entries |
| `delete` | Write | Remove entries from the table |

## Permission Model

Permissions are set per **path** within a table:

```
/                    → Can query root level
/products            → Can query products array
/products/*/price    → Can read individual product prices
```

## Example Configuration

In the PuppyOne dashboard, you can configure:

1. **Read-only access** — Agent can only query, not modify
2. **Full access** — Agent can read and write
3. **Path-scoped access** — Agent can only access specific paths

## Best Practices

1. **Start with read-only** — Add write permissions only when needed
2. **Scope to specific paths** — Don't give agents access to entire tables
3. **Use separate tables** — Split public/private data into different tables
