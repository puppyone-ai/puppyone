# Core Concepts

Understanding PuppyOne's architecture and data model.

## Overview

PuppyOne organizes your context into a simple hierarchy:

```
Workspace (your account)
└── Project (a context namespace)
    └── Table (a JSON document)
        └── Data (structured JSON)
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Project** | Top-level container. One project = one context namespace. |
| **Table** | A structured JSON document within a project. |
| **MCP** | Protocol for serving context to AI agents. |
| **Tools** | Operations agents can perform (query, create, update, delete). |
