# Project & Table

How PuppyOne organizes your context data.

## Project

A **Project** is the top-level container for your context. Think of it as a namespace or workspace.

- Each project has a unique ID
- Projects contain multiple Tables
- Access control is set at project level

## Table

A **Table** is a structured JSON document within a project.

- Tables store your actual context data as JSON
- Each table can have nested objects and arrays
- Version history is tracked automatically
- Access permissions can be set per-table

## Example Structure

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "SKU-001",
      "name": "Widget Pro",
      "price": 99.99,
      "specs": {
        "weight": "250g",
        "dimensions": "10x5x3 cm"
      }
    }
  ],
  "categories": ["Electronics", "Tools"]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **One project per domain** — e.g., "Product Catalog", "Support Knowledge"
2. **Tables for logical groupings** — e.g., "products", "categories", "faqs"
3. **Keep nesting shallow** — Agents work better with flatter structures
