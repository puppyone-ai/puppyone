By automatically scheduling appointments based on candidates availability and scanning resumes for key expertise, fewer HR representatives need to work on heavily manual tasks. Instead, they can focus on higher value tasks. For example, AI can schedule interviews based on available time, saving HR professionals from having to check their calendars and find the appropriate time to interview candidates."
