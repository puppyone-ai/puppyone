## GET /v1/namespaces/:namespace/hint\_cache\_warm

Signal turbopuffer to prepare for low-latency requests

Hints turbopuffer that the client will send latency-sensitive requests in the near future,
so that turbopuffer can get ready to serve those requests with low (warm) latency.
turbopuffer responds by acknowledging the request.

### Billing

If turbopuffer is ready to serve requests with low latency, or it is already getting
the namespace ready for low-latency queries, this request is free.
Otherwise, this request is billed as a query that returns zero rows.

### Use cases

A common use case is for applications to send hints for all namespaces associated
with a user whenever a user begins a new session, so that users don't experience
cold latency when they trigger their first turbopuffer query.

### Examples

python

curlpythontypescriptgojavaruby

```python
import turbopuffer

tpuf = turbopuffer.Turbopuffer(
    region='gcp-us-central1', # pick the right region: https://turbopuffer.com/docs/regions
)

ns = tpuf.namespace('warm-cache-example-py')

print(ns.hint_cache_warm())
# NamespaceHintCacheWarmResponse(status='ACCEPTED', message='cache warm hint accepted')
```
