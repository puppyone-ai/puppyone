"""Diagnose and repair "Damaged folder" dangling subtrees for a project.

A "Damaged folder" is a tree entry whose subtree object is missing from the
object store while a parent tree still references it (see
``project_damaged_folder_dangling_tree``). This tool runs IN the backend
context (where the object store is reachable), so it can do what the read-only
HTTP API cannot: tell whether each damaged folder is actually RECOVERABLE.

For every damaged folder it searches for a fully-present replacement subtree:
  1. a per-scope ``scope_hash`` whose path matches the folder exactly, then
  2. any historical project root that resolves the folder's path cleanly.
If one is found the folder is recoverable (tier ①) — ``--apply`` re-grafts it
into the live root via a single CAS. If none is found the folder's content is
genuinely gone (tier ②) and the only cleanup is to delete the dead entry.

Usage (run where DB + object store env is configured, e.g. the prod backend):

    python -m scripts.repair_damaged_folders <project_id>            # dry-run
    python -m scripts.repair_damaged_folders <project_id> --apply    # recover

Dry-run is read-only. ``--apply`` only ever GRAFTS recovered subtrees back in
(never deletes), so it cannot lose data; unrecoverable folders are left as-is
and reported for manual deletion.
