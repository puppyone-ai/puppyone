"""Session-management policy — the core of the sandbox feature.

A scope's sandbox should stay warm when it's likely to be reused soon (so users
don't wait for a full re-pull) and be reclaimed when it isn't (to save cost).
Because the server is the git source of truth, destroying a sandbox never loses
data — the only cost of destroying is the next full pull. So the decision is a
trade-off between *warm idle cost* and *cold restart cost*, driven by metrics:

  - recency        how long since the last activity
  - frequency      how many ops in a recent window (a "hot" scope)
  - users          how many distinct users used it recently (shared scope)
  - restart cost   measured full-pull seconds (bigger repo ⇒ pricier to destroy)

Two-step reclamation mirrors the three-state model: an idle RUNNING sandbox is
first STOPPED (compute off, disk kept → cheap, fast resume), and only a
long-idle STOPPED sandbox is DESTROYED (frees disk → next use needs a full
pull). Under capacity pressure, the lowest-value sessions are evicted first.

Everything here is a pure function of (session, now, config) so it is fully
unit-testable without a provider or a clock.
