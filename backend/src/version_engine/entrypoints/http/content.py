"""Content API — REST HTTP shell for ProductOperationAdapter.

Provides POSIX-like file system operations (ls, cat, write, mkdir, mv, rm)
on the version content tree. Used by the frontend Web UI and internal services.

Split into sub-modules for maintainability:
  content_read.py     — ls, cat, stat, tree
  content_write.py    — write, mkdir, mv, rm, bulk-write
  content_history.py  — versions, version-content, diff, rollback
