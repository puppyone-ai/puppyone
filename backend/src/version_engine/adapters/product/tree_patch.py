"""tree_splice — direct Git-tree mutations for typed write operations.

Each function transforms a scope's tree:

    (store, root_hash, ...) -> (new_root_hash, changes)

``changes`` is a list of ``("add"|"update"|"delete", rel_path)`` tuples in
the same order the version history schema expects. The caller is responsible
for prefixing ``rel_path`` with the scope path before persisting.

Cost: ``O(D)`` per mutation where ``D`` is the depth of the affected path
(typically < 10), independent of total scope size. This keeps product writes
on the same shallow Git-tree update model as scoped Git submissions instead
of flattening the whole repository for every operation.

Move / rename operations do **not** download blob contents. They
relocate tree-node hashes only. Folder rename of a 1000-file subtree
costs the same as a 1-file rename.

Idempotency: when the mutation produces the same root hash as the input
(e.g. writing identical content, deleting a missing path), ``changes`` is
empty. Callers should detect this and skip CAS / history / audit — that's
how the editor's repeat-save case avoids polluting history.

Concurrency: these functions are pure with respect to the underlying
``ObjectStore`` (writes are content-addressed and idempotent). They can
be retried safely inside a CAS loop.

    For N puts spanning M unique parent directories (M ≤ N), this

        - exactly 1 tree node per directory along the union spine
          of all affected paths,
        - regardless of N.

    Compare with calling :func:`splice_put_blob_ref` N times in
    sequence: each per-op call rewrites every directory along ITS
    own spine, so the same parent (e.g. ``docdocs/``) ends up
    being written N times, once per leaf added — generating
    N − 1 wasted intermediate tree nodes that nobody will ever
    read. For N=3 files in one folder that's 4 wasted PUTs to
    Supabase Storage at ~1s each. This batched version eliminates
    those entirely.

    Best case (every file in the same parent dir — typical folder
    upload): 1 parent tree node + 1 root tree node, regardless of N.
    Worst case (every file in a different sibling directory at
    different depths): no worse than N × splice_put_blob_ref calls
    in terms of S3 puts; substantially fewer reads because each
    intermediate directory is read at most once.

        ``items`` is a list of ``(rel_path, blob_hash)`` tuples.

        last-write-wins (matches the per-op loop semantics).
        Identical content at an existing path is a no-op (no
        tree write, no audit entry).

    writes — a malformed input (empty path, empty hash) doesn't

    Each op is applied in order against the running root. The final
    root is returned with the union of all changes — bulk-write
    uses this so N writes + M deletes + K moves
    against a single scope produce one commit.

    Optimization: consecutive runs of ``put`` / ``put_ref`` ops are
    coalesced into a single :func:`splice_multi_put_refs` call, so
    a folder upload of N files in the same directory writes the
    parent tree node ONCE (not N times). Order is preserved:
    we only group within runs, never across an ``rm`` / ``mv``
    boundary. That's because reordering across a remove like
    ``put a/x; rm a; put a/y`` would produce a different end state
    (``put`` first would overwrite the other ``put``'s parent).

    Overlapping ops within a single run (e.g. ``put a`` then ``put a``
    with different bytes) are resolved last-write-wins, matching
    what the previous per-op loop did. Callers wanting dedupe
    should filter before calling.
