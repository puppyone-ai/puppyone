# === Backend-Proxied Multipart Upload Schemas ===
#
# Four-step protocol with all bytes flowing through the FastAPI
# process (rather than browser → S3 directly):
#   1. /upload/init     — initiate S3 multipart, allocate a pending
#                         task, return ``upload_id`` + ``s3_key``.
#   2. /upload/part     — browser PUTs each part to the backend; the
#                         backend forwards to S3 via boto3
#                         ``upload_part`` and returns the ``ETag``.
#   3. /upload/complete — finalize the multipart upload + write the
#                         assembled bytes into MUT (see batch variant).
#   4. /upload/abort    — cancel an in-flight upload (idempotent).
#
# Why proxy through the backend instead of presigned URLs to S3?
# Some S3-compatible providers (notably Supabase Storage's S3
# emulation) don't expose ``PutBucketCors`` and the dashboard CORS
# settings only cover the REST API, not the S3 endpoint. This means
# direct browser → S3 PUTs are blocked by browser CORS no matter
# what — there's no setting that would fix it. Proxying through
# our FastAPI process sidesteps the issue entirely (browser →
# Next.js is same-origin; Next.js → FastAPI → S3 is server-to-
# server, neither pays the CORS tax). Trade-off: ~15-30% slower
# than direct-to-S3 due to the extra hop, plus backend bandwidth.
# Acceptable because:
#   - typical files are small-medium (PDF/MD/JSON)
#   - large/folder uploads should use the local sync daemon, which
#     survives tab close, network drops, and reboots — strictly
#     better reliability than any browser flow can offer.
